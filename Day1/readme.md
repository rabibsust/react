# Day 1 | What is React and how it works

In the first day we learned about the React library.

React.JS is a JS library which is a collection of vanilla JS by which we can build User Interfaces.

There are two types. React DOM for creating web application and React Native for making mobile apps.

Why we use React?

- React is used for making scalable UI elements. Using vanilla JS or jQuery it is really hard to create reusable components which can be used in different area.

- Using React we can create components and these components can be used anywhere in the application. Without requiring to create multiple ids, htmls etc.

- React is a platform agnostic library. We can create DOM element or Native element and use the same react functionality to create Native or web apps.

- React HTML contains a `root` div. In that div all the react components are loaded.
